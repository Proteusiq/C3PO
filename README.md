# Agents: Towards Digital C-3PO

Welcome to the future where Large Language Models (LLMs) are more than just responders—they’re thinkers, planners, and doers. I’m starting a LLM Monday-short-article series that shares tools and code snippets used in giving machines sophisticated abilities to accomplish complex tasks.

🍪What to Expect: 
 • Insights into the latest tools and technologies driving this evolution.
 • Practical examples for applying LLM agents.
 • An exploration into the future possibilities these agents hold.
